# Welcome to the tileset file.
#
# The pound (#) symbols are comments. They only
# work if the # is at the beginning of the line.
# Empty lines are not parsed either.
#
# The syntax for this file is:
# <char> <imagepath> [keywords]
#
# The image path is relative to res/ folder.
# Do not include the file extension (always MCI).
# If image path is null, it won't render.
#
# The OPTIONAL case-insensitive keywords are:
# - solid - The character can't walk through tile
# - fluid - The character can walk through tile
# - dangerous - Kills the character on touch
# - safe - Doesn't kill the character on touch
# - spawn - Spawn tile-- character spawns here
# - checkpoint - Sets a checkpoint to spawn at on touch
# - nojump - Disable jumping on tile
# - jump - Enable jumping on tile
# - dither - Enable dithering while on tile
# - lock - Disable panning (right-click)
# - unlock - Enable panning (right-click)
# - default - Replace spaces by default with tile
# - replace=<char> - Replaces tile with char
# - speed=<double> - Sets the speed while on tile
# - filter=<int> - Sets the percent darkness to apply
# - particle={...} - Create particles when player touches tile; parameters are comma-separated; no spaces allowed in parameters
#   - Please note that the string "[min|max]" will be replaced with a random double from min to max on game init; ex. [0.1|1]
#   - color:<string> - Sets the color of the particle
#   - count:<int> - Number of particles to create every `iteration` ticks
#   - iteration:<int> - create `count` particles every `iteration` ticks
#   - lifetime:<int/string> - how long particles last. Ex. 5=5 ticks, 1.4s=1.4 seconds
#   - xacceleration:<double> - how much to accelerate every tick on the x axis
#   - yacceleration:<double> - how much to accelerate every tick on the y axis
#   - front:<boolean> - if true, particles render on top of players; else behind
