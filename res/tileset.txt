# Welcome to the tileset file.
#
# The pound (#) symbols are comments. They only
# work if the # is at the beginning of the line.
# Empty lines are not parsed either.
#
# The syntax for this file is:
# <char> <imagepath> [keywords]
#
# The image path is relative to res/ folder.
# Do not include the file extension (always PNG).
# If image path is null, it won't render.
#
# The OPTIONAL case-insensitive keywords are:
# - solid - The character can't walk through tile
# - fluid - The character can walk through tile
# - dangerous - Kills the character on touch
# - safe - Doesn't kill the character on touch
# - spawn - Spawn tile-- character spawns here
# - replace=<char> - Replaces tile with char
# - speed=<double> - Sets the speed while on tile

# Default tiles
? tiles/null safe solid
S null safe fluid spawn replace=tiles/dirt
D tiles/dirt safe fluid
. tiles/water safe fluid speed=0.2
